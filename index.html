            Converting a React / Redux site to a new design, updating redux
            according to a new api &amp; adding new components and
            functionality. CI with github &amp; Jenkins. Returned for a quick
            client christmas card quiz microsite, and again for a React
            microsite with several simple JS minigames.

            Working again with some of the VooDooBytes team I came on to build
            out the front end of an e-commerce site in React, first implementing
            new components, then leading on upgrading from a rigid desktop site
            to being responsive and device agnostic.
